RESTful API:
Representational State Transfer API.
Has some Standard/Rules or best practices which defines it.

(1)Consumer View Point
(2)HTTP methods usage
(3)Structure Request and Response

Works on Server-Client Architecture,
Seperate those entities and write logic accordingly.

Server Side Rendering(although Fast and Secure) should not happen.
Web fetch data from Database on server side, then in which format should we send the data : JSON, client could thus process the data in its own way.
Frontend could be handled by anything, the data could be utilized in their own way to render.
(Client Side Rendering) which React does. Fetch-->Render.

HTTP methods must work as per their roles only.
Ex: POST request shouldn't be used for update, delete or any other functionality (POST/updateUser, POST/deleteUser, etc)
Each method must solely be used for it's original purpose.
GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE must be used for their own purpose.

Browsers by default use GET requests. Thus, POSTMAN used to check and validate APIs for POST, PATCH, DELETE methods.
POSTMAN is used for API testing.

Client <=====APIs=====> Server 
CRUD operations need to be done here

REST was created to create standards for communication between two servers.
Resource oriented architecture, client-server based architecture, developed using http.
Best practices:
Name endpoint as per the http method.
Return standard error codes to the result of out API.
Support for Filter, Sort and Pagination.
Endpoints name should be plural.
Follow Endpoints name should be plural. (SSL/TLS)
Caching.
Versioning.
